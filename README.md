Product images, logos and more from every pokemon trading card set ever released.
Nearly all images are as high-quality as possible and the goal is to have all images transparent.

Putting this collection together took alomst half a year, so i hope someone else can just use it instead of searching for theirselves. :)


Currently i'm trying to collect the following assets:

- Packshots / Booster Images
- Elite Trainer Boxes
- Collections
- Blisters
- Pins
- Logos
- Symbols
- Banners

For now the collection is only in english, but i'm planning on adding german and french images as well.
